    derivative operator. If there are n spatial variables, then this should be a
    n + 1 element array, whose 0 element holds the number of time derivatives,
    and whose ith element (for i > 0) holds the derivative order with respect to
    the i-1th spatial variable. Currently, we only support n = 1, 2, 3.

    Order : This is the sum of the elements of Encoding. It represents the
    total number of partial derivatives we must take to apply a derivative
    operator to a function. We need this when computing the integral of a weight
    function times a library term (we apply integration by parts once for each
    partial derivative in the Derivative operator). """
