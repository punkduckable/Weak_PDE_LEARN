    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Arguments:

    Inputs: If U is a function of one spatial variable, then this should

    ith data point. If U is a function of two spatial variables, then this
    should be a three column tensor whose ith row holds the (t, x, y)

    Arguments:

    U: The Neural Network that approximates the solution.

    final one is for a constant term).

    Coll_Points: A 2 or 3 column tensor of coordinates. If

    = 2, then the ith row of this tensor holds the (t, x, y) coordiante of the

    Time_Derivative_Order: We try to solve a PDE of the form (d^n U/dt^n) =
    N(U, D_{x}U, ...). This is the 'n' on the left-hand side of that PDE.

    Highest_Order_Spatial_Derivatives: The highest order derivatives in our
    library terms. We need to know this to evaluate the spatial partial
    derivatives of Xi and, subsequently, evaluate the library terms.

    Index_to_Derivatives: If Num_Spatial_Dimensions = 1, then this maps
    sub-index value to a number of x derivatives. If Num_Spatial_Dimensions = 2,
    then this maps a sub-index value to a number of x and y derivatives.

    Col_Number_to_Multi_Index: This maps column numbers (library term numbers)
