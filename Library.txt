# This file defines the PDE that we search for. Weak PDE-LEARN can identify
# PDEs of the following form:
#     D^{(0)} F_0(U) = c_1 D^{(1)} F_1(U) + ... + c_K D^{(K)} F_K(U)
# Here, U is the PDE solution (which depends on (t, x), (t, x, y), or
# (t, x, y, z)) depending on the number of PDE terms. F_0, ... , F_K are scalar
# valued functions of U (NOT its derivatives). We call these "Trial functions".
#  D^{(0)}, ... , D^{(K)} are partial derivative operators. We call terms of the
# form D^{(i)} F_i(U) a "Library term". We call the term D^{(0)} F_0(U) the
# "LEft Hand Side Term" or "LHS Term" for short, and the terms D^{(i)} F_i(U),
# for i >= 1, the "Right Hand Side Terms" or "RHS Terms" for short.
#
# This file specifies Library terms. Since the LHS Term has a special
# designation, we specify it separately. Each trial function must be a power
# of U (I may weaken this requirement in the future). We use the constant "1"
# as a shorthand for U^0. This program can recognize expressions of the
# form U^p, as well as multiplicative products of U, such as U*U. For example,
# the following examples all mean "U^3":
#       U^3
#       U^2*U
#       U*U^2
#       U*U*U
#       1*U^3
#       U^3*1
# Derivatives must be expressed as a sequence of partial derivatives. Each
# partial derivative should be of the form D_s (for first order derivatives) or
# D_s^k (for higher order derivatives). There should be a space between each
# partial derivative. For example, D_t D_x^2 D_y. The derivative should come
# before the trial function, with a space between the two. For example, the
# following means "second x partial and first y partial of U^4"
#       D_x^2 D_t U^4
# If a Library term has no derivative (D^{(i)} = 1), then you simply do not
# list one. For example, the following line specifies the Library term U^2,
#       U^2
# The first library term you specify is the LHS term. There can be blank lines,
# comments, etc between library terms. The only rules are that the library
# terms adhere to the format above and that there is at most one library term
# per line.
